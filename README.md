# Butler

Firebird Butler repository for specifications, descriptions and other project-wide documents in their source formats. The primary purpose is to collect specifications for APIs, file formats, wire protocols, and processes.

The change process is C4: http://firebird-butler.rtfd.io/rfc/1/C4.html with a few modifications:

- A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to C4.
- Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to Butler repository as needed.
- Specification life-cycle SHOULD follow the life-cycle defined in COSS: http://firebird-butler.rtfd.io/rfc/2/COSS.html
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.

All published specifications and other related documents in HTML and other readable formats are available at http://firebird-butler.rtfd.io
