- A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to C4.
- Each specification has an editor who publishes the RFC to the `Butler repository`_ as needed.
- Specification lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in :doc:`2/COSS </rfc/2/COSS>`
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on Raw and Draft specifications.
